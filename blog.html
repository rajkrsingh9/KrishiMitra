            <h1>Revolutionizing Agriculture with AI: How KrishiMitra Empowers Farmers</h1>
    
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Agriculture is the lifeline of our economy, yet millions of farmers struggle with unpredictable weather, 
                inefficient irrigation, and lack of real-time data. KrishiMitra is changing this by integrating AI, IoT, 
                and data analytics to provide smart, sustainable, and profitable farming solutions.
            </p>
    
            <h2>The Challenges Farmers Face</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>🌾 <b>Uncertain Crop Selection</b> – Farmers often rely on tradition rather than data to choose crops, leading to losses.</li>
                <li>💧 <b>Water Wastage</b> – Unplanned irrigation drains resources, causing soil degradation and lower yields.</li>
                <li>📉 <b>Market Volatility</b> – Farmers grow crops without knowing future market demand, resulting in overproduction and financial losses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>The Water Footprint of Crops: Which Crops Use the Most and Least Water?</h1>
            <p>
                Did you know that growing 1 kg of rice requires about 2,500 liters of water, while 1 kg of potatoes needs only 290 liters? 
                Understanding a crop’s water footprint can help farmers choose water-efficient crops, conserve resources, and boost sustainability. 
                This blog explores the water usage of different crops and how farmers can optimize their choices for maximum yield with minimal water use.
            </p>
    
            <h1>The Role of AI in Sustainable Agriculture: How Data-Driven Farming is Changing the Game</h1>
            <p>
                Traditional farming relies on experience, but AI-powered tools bring precision, efficiency, and sustainability. 
                From crop prediction models to AI-based pest control and irrigation, technology is helping farmers make smarter 
                decisions and reduce waste. Learn how AI is revolutionizing farming and why data-driven agriculture is the future.
